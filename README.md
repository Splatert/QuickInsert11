Insert Roblox Parts Via GUI (Roblox Studio 2011 &amp; 2012)


The reason I made this was because leaving out of Studio's 3D view to navigate the surrounding UI causes studio to not respond for nearly a second and I wanted a way to
quickly insert parts without that inconvenience and as well as not scroll through the Objects library to look for what I want.


## Usage
Whenever you load up a place on Roblox Studio, run the script by going over to **Tools > Execute Script** then choose the script.
