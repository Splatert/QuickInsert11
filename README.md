Insert Roblox Parts Via GUI (Roblox Studio 2011 &amp; 2012)


The reason for creating this was because leaving out of Studio's 3D view to navigate surrounding UI elements causes studio to not respond for nearly a second so I wanted a way to
quickly insert objects without that inconvenience and as well as not scroll through the Objects library to look for what I want.


## Usage
Whenever you load up a place on Roblox Studio, run the script by going over to **Tools > Execute Script** then choose the script.

Hope you find this useful.
